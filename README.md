In this repo, you will find two scripts, one for PyBank and one for PyPoll 

### PyBank 

I created a Python script to analyze the financial records of a financial dataset called `budget_data.csv`. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

The Python script analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

## PyPoll

I created a Python script to analyze the votes from a set of poll data called `election_data.csv`. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 

The Python script calculates each of the following values:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote


My final scripts print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
